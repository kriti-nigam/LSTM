# LSTM
multi-class text classification using sequence models
The data set consists of tweets which are categorized into 13 different emotions. 
In this repo we are basically working with multi labelled emotion dataset for sentiment analysis of tweets.

The procedure shall involve data cleaning, data preprocessing,tokenizing, vectorization and modeling. We used three models- LSTM with random embedding, LSTM with a pre-trained GloVe embedding and added CNN layer to the LSTM+GloVe architecture. You can find the code in the .ipynb file
